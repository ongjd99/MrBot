# MrBot

A Discord bot in order to help moderate your Discord server or bring it some more life via "for fun" commands. The bot is currently capable of an 8ball functionality, creating and maintaining a list of restricted words, which of spoken will automatically delete messages and warn users, and translate messages from English into Spanish. This bot was created to practice the use of different API's, mainly Discord's API, as well as a way to have fun when talking to friends in Discord that was customizable and suitable for my own tastes..

The project makes use of Python's Async features which allows other tasks to be done concurrently, making it perfect for usage amongst multiple users at once. Using Discord's API allows us to read and write messages back to the server as well as grant specific permissiosn to the bot itself enabling it to have slight moderation powers in the form of deleting inappropriate messages. The project also utilizes a translation API, which saves a message and sends a request for translation before sending it back into the same server. The bot is also able to be hosted on Replit and connect to Replit's web server in order to keep the bot constantly running. Without Replit, the owner of the bot would have to continuously run the bot on their computer but with Replit the owner would only have to ping the bot every now which can be automated.
